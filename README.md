## Overview
This project is a multi-page CSS Grid-based site built from a Figma design file. This one presented several challenges in the layout of the CSS Grid, it's a fairly complex layout with variations for desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes. I enjoyed putting this one together!  
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
